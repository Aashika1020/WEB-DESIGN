                    <p style="font-size: x-large;">24/7 continuous operation is critical when doing business on the Internet. In the event of failure of your primary mail server your email will be automatically redirected to our backup mail secondary server and held in a queue until your server comes back online.</p><br><br>
                    <p style="font-size: x-large;">Our backup secondary mail servers will also scan and clean your email of viruses and spam.</p><br><br>
                    <p style="font-size:x-large;">Our backup MX server mail service is ideal for when you are running your own mail server and you want to ensure you do not lose any mail during unexpected downtime or when your primary mail server is too busy!</p><br>

                    <h1><u>How does this work?</u></h1><br>
                    <img src="backupmx2.jpg"align="center" width="650px" height="350px"><br><br><br>
                    <p style="font-size: x-large;">A backup email server service, is a group of servers on the Internet that temporarily queues your incoming email should your primary mail server be unavailable for any reason.</p><br><br>
                    <p style="font-size: x-large;">When an email client tries to send emails, it lookups the domain's DNS to find out what the mail exchangers (MX) are for the domain. Each MX record is given a preference number and the lowest becomes the primary mail server.</p><br><br>
                    <p style="font-size: x-large;">Mail delivery is first attempted on the lowest preference number MX. If the delivery fails, it tries the second lowest preference MX and so on. If no mail servers can be reached then the mail will be bounced back to the sender.</p><br>
                    <p style="font-size: x-large;">Our mail backup service can act as your second or third priority mail server. If your mail server cannot be reached, then your email will be routed to our mail backup server and wait in queues.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: x-large;"> Our server will keep checking your mail server every 15 minutes. Once your mail server is detected available, our backup mail server will then forward the emails to your mail server. Our mail server will keep attempting to deliver your mail to your server for 6 days or longer if you require. Mails queued in our mail server exceeding this time will be returned to the sender.</p>

                    <ul><p style="font-size: x-large;">There can be many reasons why your primary email system may become unavailable, including :</p><br>
                        <li>Mail server failure</li>
                        <li>Local network failure or Internet connectivity is down or saturated</li>
                        <li>Overloaded or unable to deal with new connections</li>
                        <li>It is down while being rebooted after a security patch</li>
                        <li>Offline due to an extended maintenance upgrade</li>
                        <li>Being Hacked/Targeted by DOS attacks or spammers, etc.</li>
                    <br><br><ul><p style="font-size: x-large;">If any of these situations should occur, then email will be diverted to your backup mail service. Without a backup service any of the following will happen:</p><br>
                        <li>Email will be bounced back to the sender</li>
                        <li>Email could be lost</li>
                        <li>A correctly configured backup MX service will ensure that you never lose an important email.</li>
                    <br><br><p style="font-size: x-large;">In the event of failure of your primary mail server your email will be automatically redirected to our backup mail server and held in a queue until your server comes back online.</p>
