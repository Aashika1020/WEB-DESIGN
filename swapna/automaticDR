                    <p style="font-size: x-large;">24/7 continuous operation is critical when doing business on the Internet. Unfortunately, you are vulnerable to all kinds of disasters from hardware failures to network outages which can quickly bring down your web site servers.</p><br><br>
                    <h3>Automatic DR (Disaster/Recovery) Failover Service works by continuously monitoring, testing your web-servers and dynamically updating DNS (Domain Name Service) records.</h3><br><br>
                    <p style="font-size:x-large;"> In event of failure of your primary web-server your visitors will be automatically redirected to the backup web-server. The web-server computers involved in this do not need to be in the same location, reducing vulnerability considerably.</p><br>
                    <p style="font-size: x-large;">You do not need to have your servers with us, you could have two or more servers maintained by different providers in different locations of the world, which would practically eliminate the risk of any one disaster bringing down your web servers. </p>
                    <p style="font-size:x-large;">Another option could be for us to just provide you with generic low-cost web-service as a backup for your primary server, finally making failover protection available even to those with limited IT budgets.</p><br>
                    <p style="font-style: italic;">Note: in order to use this service you will need to have your domain name records maintained by us, so they can be dynamically be updated.</p><br>

                    <ul class="">
                        <li style="font-size:x-large;">This service can also be used to provide failover protection not just for HTTP web servers, but many other types of servers: FTP, SMTP, POP3, NNTP, IMAP, other generic TCP connect or ping servers.</li><br>
                        <li style="font-size: x-large;">The service can also be used to provide a sophisticated network monitoring solution that allows network administrators, webmasters, and Internet service providers to monitor any networked device on the Internet, and receive alerts immediately via e-mail, or third-party software when a connection fails.</li><br>
                        <li style="font-size: x-large;">It is a powerful monitoring service delivering low cost, simplicity of operation, and round-the-clock coverage.</li><br></p>
